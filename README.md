# fiskkit-scraper

An article extractor which when given a url string as input will scrape the complete text of the article and return it as a text file. 

## Example Input

Your method can take as input the following url string:

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/08/21/swat-lobby-takes-a-shot-at-congress.html

News articles are structured differently so your extractor may not work for all of them, but should at least work for the one provided in the example.

## Constraints

Use either Angular or JavaScript
